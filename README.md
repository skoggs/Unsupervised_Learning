# Unsupervised_Learning
This is a demonstration of unsupervised learning (a subtype of machine learning) that uses cryptocurrencies as a back drop to try out a few elbow tests and chart out some PCA trends. 

A working knowledge of unsuspervised learning is highly recommended to navigate the code, although having a quick reference to the terms will at least help you get through it.

The code itself has plenty of comments and should mostly be self-explanatory for users of Python the accompanying plugins.
